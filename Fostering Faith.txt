Fostering Faith
Will you slip through the system’s wide cracks
Like a ball down a driveway’s storm drain
Will you bounce between homes leaving tracks
That they’ll only retrace if you’re slain?
See the case plan is hard to believe
When so many are carelessly tossed
Doomed to land where no love can retrieve
Even bits of the little lives lost
Yet my soul says Perhaps there still stands
In the darkest of gutters a guard
One whose outstretched and welcoming hands
Have no cracks just two holes that have scarred
